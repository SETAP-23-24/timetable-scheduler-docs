Installation
------------

To use our app, first clone the github repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/SETAP-23-24/timetable-scheduler.git

Importing a timetable
----------------

Currently you can only import a timetable in the form of a link to an ical file. 

If your University uses the CMISGO timetable system, it is incredibly easy to get that link.

These are the steps:
- Click on administration in the top right.
- Click on my mobile in the drop down.
- Copy the ics link shown.

Once you have the link paste that into our app and *voila* you have successfully imported your timetable. Well Done!

Using the settings page
----------------

The settings page is where you can change the settings of the app. 
You can change:
- The time yow want to get notified about your classes for the day.
- The link to your timetable .ics file. if you want to change it.
- The way your route is calculated. You can choose your mode of transport
- If you want to be routed to your classes or not.
- If you want to use the dark mode or not.
- where your home address is. This is used to calculate the route to your classes.
