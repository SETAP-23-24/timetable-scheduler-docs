Installation
------------

To use our app, first clone the github repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/SETAP-23-24/timetable-scheduler.git

Importing a timetable
----------------

Currently you can only import a timetable in the form of a link to an ical file. 

If your University uses the CMISGO timetable system, it is incredibly easy to get that link.

These are the steps:
- Click on administration in the top right.
- Click on my mobile in the drop down.
- Copy the ics link shown.

Once you have the link paste that into our app and *voila* you have successfully imported your timetable. Well done!
